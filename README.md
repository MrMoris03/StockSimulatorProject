# StockSimulatorProject
  Simulate buying, selling, and tracking stock prices.


How It Works:

Stock Prices: The program defines a set of stocks with predefined prices. The simulate_price_change function randomly adjusts the stock prices by a small percentage (between -5% and +5%).

Portfolio: The user has a portfolio where they can track their stock holdings (quantities of each stock).

Buying/Selling Stocks:

Users can buy stocks by selecting a ticker symbol and specifying the number of shares.
Users can sell stocks they own by selecting a ticker symbol and the number of shares to sell.

Viewing Stocks & Portfolio:
Users can view a list of available stocks with their current prices.
Users can also view their portfolio with details about each stock they own, including its current price and total value.

Price Updates:
The updatePrice function simulates market changes by randomly adjusting the stock prices.
